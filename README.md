## Dataset
We provide the WebCars dataset here 
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8FVP4UlazP8Q2N0czB3aFNVWk0/view?usp=sharing

## Code
The code are written using Lasagne.

__utils.py__: provide necessary functions  
__vggnet.py__: define network structure  
__train.py__: main file, implementing training and testing   
__config.yaml__: define the necessary hyperparameters (e.g., data directory, bag size, GPU), please modify this file  
__./pretrained_model__: the pretrained VGG16 model on ImageNet  
__img_mean.npy__: mean file for data preprocessing  


## Training

```
python train.py

```
